# Nexus - Requirements Specification

## 1. Overview
**Nexus** is an internal web application designed to help student teams monitor and evaluate their own capstone project progress. The system aligns with the **Water-Scrum-Fall (WSF)** methodology and focuses on tracking phases, deliverables, sprints, timelines, and individual contributions.

This system is a support and self-monitoring tool used alongside the actual capstone project.

## 2. Objectives
- **Centralize Project Metadata:** Store project title, academic term, and repository links.
- **Track Progress:** Monitor WSF phases, deliverables, and sprints.
- **Contextualize Work:** Allow commenting on tasks and deliverables (e.g., explaining blockers).
- **Audit & Evidence:** Record contributions, meeting logs, and evidence files.
- **Data Safety:** Prevent data loss via soft deletes and history logging.

## 3. Target Users

*   **Team Member**
    *   Update assigned tasks (including blocking issues).
    *   Add comments to explain progress or blockers.
    *   Upload evidence.

    *   View progress dashboards.
*   **Team Lead / Project Manager**
    *   **Onboarding:** Create team member accounts via email invitation.

### 5.2 Routing (Next.js App Router)
The application shall implement **file-system based routing** using the Next.js App Router structure.

*   **Route Map:**
    *   `/login` – (`app/login/page.tsx`) Entry point.
    *   `/dashboard` – (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`) Overall progress overview.
    *   `/phases` – (`app/phases/page.tsx`) Waterfall, Scrum, and Fall phase tracking.
    *   `/sprints` – (`app/sprints/page.tsx`) Sprint list.
    *   `/sprints/[id]` – (`app/sprints/[id]/page.tsx`) Task board for a specific sprint.
    *   `/meetings` – (`app/meetings/page.tsx`) Repository of uploaded meeting minutes.
    *   `/deliverables` – (`app/deliverables/page.tsx`) Evidence and document uploads.
    *   `/settings` – (`app/settings/page.tsx`) Team configuration, User Management, and Backup.

*   **Rules:**
    *   **Middleware:** A `middleware.ts` file must protect all routes except `/login` and static assets.
    *   **Layouts:** A root layout (`app/layout.tsx`) or group layout (`app/(authenticated)/layout.tsx`) must handle the sidebar/navigation for logged-in users.

### 5.3 Project & Phase Management (WSF)
*   **Project Settings:** Define Title, Description, and Global Deadlines (stored as a singleton entity).
*   **Phases:**
    1.  **Waterfall** (Planning & Design)
    2.  **Scrum** (Development & Iteration)
    3.  **Fall** (Testing, Deployment, Closure)
*   Each phase must contain a list of required deliverables.
*   Each deliverable must have a status: *Not Started, In Progress, Review, Completed*.

### 5.4 Deliverable Tracking
*   Users must be able to view required deliverables per phase.
*   Users must be able to upload evidence (PDFs, images).
*   **Comments:** Users can add comments to deliverables (e.g., feedback on rejection).
*   **Safety:** Deleting a deliverable or evidence must perform a **Soft Delete**.

### 5.5 Sprint & Task Management
*   **Sprints:** Must allow creation with Tasks, Assigned Members, Start/End Dates, and Status.
*   **Tasks:** Must support:
    *   Description & Assignment.
    *   **Status:** *Todo, In Progress, Blocked, Done*.
    *   **Blockers:** Tasks marked as "Blocked" must require a **Comment** explaining the reason.

### 5.6 Progress Dashboard
The dashboard must display:
*   Overall project completion percentage.
*   Phase-level progress.
*   Sprint completion status.
*   **Notifications:** Alert list for assigned tasks, blockers, or mentions.

### 5.7 Contribution Tracking
*   System must record tasks completed per member.
*   System must record sprint participation.
*   Contribution summaries must be viewable by the Team Lead.

### 5.8 Timeline & Gantt View
*   Display a timeline comparing **Planned Dates** vs **Actual Completion Dates**.
*   Delays must be visually indicated.

### 5.9 Audit & Activity Logging
*   The system must maintain an immutable history of critical actions.
*   **Logged Events:** Task status changes, File uploads, Deliverable approvals.
*   **Visible to:** Team Leads (to resolve disputes on who did what).

### 5.10 Meeting Minutes (PDF/Image Upload)
*   Users must be able to upload a PDF or Image file representing the "Minutes of Meeting" (MoM).
*   **Linking:** Each upload must be linked to a specific **Sprint** or a **Phase** (to allow for pre-sprint meetings during Waterfall).
*   **Required Fields:** Meeting Date, Title, File.
*   **Viewing:** Users must be able to download/preview the uploaded file.
*   **Note:** Structured data for "Attendees" or "Summary" is NOT required in the database; this information is assumed to be inside the uploaded document.

### 5.11 Data Backup
*   **Export:** Team Lead must be able to download a JSON export of current progress and a ZIP of all files (Evidence + Meeting Minutes).

### 5.12 Team Onboarding & Email Notification

*   Native Mobile application (Web only).

## 10. Success Criteria
*   The team can clearly identify their capstone progress at any time.
*   Required deliverables are tracked and evidenced.
*   Blockers are communicated clearly via comments.
*   Data is recoverable via Soft Deletes.
